### A Galvanize one-day mini-app
This project is part of a series of mini applications in which I'm given one day to build an application.
One of the challenges of this project was working with the database which is inconsistent! I'm in the process of implementing features to allow the user to edit the entries.

One of the big challenges in this project was learning client-side pagination. This was a new feature for me in this project and a key component of the design, so it was important to understand the code thoroughly. React-paginate was a big help here, along with a couple of good articles online.
