### A Galvanize one-day mini-app
This project is part of a series of mini applications in which I'm given one day to build an application.
One of the challenges of this project was working with the database which is inconsistent! I'm in the process of implementing features to allow the user to edit the entries. 

### How to run

2. Npm install in the repo
3. In the data folder, run command "json-server db.json"
